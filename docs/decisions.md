# Architecture & Principles

- **Stack**: FastAPI + Uvicorn (Python 3.11) for backend APIs; Expo/React Native (TypeScript) for the mobile client. Chosen for velocity, batteries-included DX, and a shallow learning curve for hackathon contributors.
- **Supportive Autonomy**: Keep defaults sane (env-config, logging, health checks) while leaving space for fast iteration (minimal scaffolding, no premature infra). Contributors get clarity plus room to move quickly.
